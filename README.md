Sentiment Analysis on Electric Vehicles on Twitter was conducted to perceive people's consensus when the project was conducted. A BiLSTM model was trained on word embeddings
obtained from the Sentiment140 dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140] using Glove [https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/] on the word tokens, the 
model was then fine-tuned on the EV Tweets. Spacy-NER was used on these tweets to conduct BIO on which sentiment Analysis was conducted.
